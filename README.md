# Getting it to work

This program was made on Borland C++ compiler so it is not compatible with actual systems.

In order to get this game running you need an MS-DOS emulator. Turbo C++ is an integrated development environment made from Borland which can be run on actual Windows systems using an emulated MS-DOS environment called DOSBox.

If you want to get the program working just install TurboC++, open the file on the compiler, run it and paint :art:.
